# Gridcells in action

Grid cells are neurons in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex of the mammalian brain whose activity covers the explored environment in a regular hexagonal pattern.

Here we provide Python and JavaScript code of grid cells networks using low-continuous attractor dynamics. The model relies on the simulated agent movements to generate grid cells.

You can reuse it to conduct your own computational neuroscience experiment or to implement it on a mobile robot. In fact, the following grid cells are actually running on your browser... if you are using a smartphone you can easily provide your device's accelerometer and gyroscope data to reproduce grid cells in the real world.
